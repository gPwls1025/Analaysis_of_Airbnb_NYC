Panic attacks are discrete episodes of intense fear or apprehension also characterized by the rapid and concurrent onset of several characteristic symptoms. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
        "Palpitations or increased heart rate. Sweating. Trembling. Sensations of shortness of breath. Feelings of choking. Chest pain. Nausea or abdominal distress.

The symptoms are sufficiently severe to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Panic attacks can occur in other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders as well as other Mental and Behavioural Disorders and therefore the presence of panic attacks is not in itself sufficient to assign a diagnosis of Panic Disorder.\n",

The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or else endured with intense fear or anxiety. A pattern of fear, anxiety, or avoidance related to specific objects or situations is not transient, that is, it persists for an extended period of time (e.g., at least several months).

In children and youth, attachment figures are typically parents, caregivers, or other family members, whereas in adults, they are most often a romantic partner or children. Manifestations of fear or anxiety related to separation depend on the individual’s developmental level, but may include: Persistent thoughts that harm or some other untoward event (e.g., being kidnapped) will lead to separation. Reluctance or refusal to go to school or work. Recurrent excessive distress (e.g., tantrums, social withdrawal) related to being separated from the attachment figure. Reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near the attachment figure. Recurrent nightmares about separation. Physical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, stomachache, headache, on occasions that involve separation from the attachment figure, such as leaving home to go to school or work.

The duration of the disturbance is at least one month, not limited to the first month of school. The disturbance is not due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language demanded in the social situation.

The clinical presentation is judged to be a Mental and Behavioural Disorder that shares primary clinical features with other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorders (e.g., physiological symptoms of excessive arousal, apprehension, and avoidance behaviour).

It should be clear that the panic attacks are always situationally cued, and thus are not unexpected. There is no focus of concern on the panic per se, the person’s anxiety is focused on the evaluative nature of the situation, such that people might notice the symptoms of anxiety and judge the person negatively on that basis.\n",
        "Referral:\n",
        "JL is a 28-year-old mother of two young children who was referred by her family physician for a psychiatric evaluation due to reported episodes of extreme anxiety that have made it difficult for her to accomplish her daily tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presenting Symptoms:\n",
        "During the interview, JL reports that she is happily married and is proud to be caring full time for her daughter and son, aged 2 and 8. She indicates that she works hard to ensure that her family is well cared for, accomplishing her household chores with thoughtfulness and special attention (e.g., buying healthy food and preparing wholesome meals, researching interesting crafts to do with her children, tidying the house every day). JL says that her current difficulties began when her son started primary school two years ago, and her regular routine was disrupted because she had to pick him up at the end of the school day. When the psychiatrist asks JL why this was disruptive, she replies that she often has to wait for her son among the other parents and make “small talk.” She indicates that she “dreads” these exchanges because she feels that the other parents judge what she says as “stupid.” However, when asked, she could not provide a specific example of something that any of the parents said that was judgmental. JL’s son attends a school where parents are expected to volunteer, and JL wants to do this “to be a good mother.”  Since the middle of the school year, JL has acted as a lunch monitor twice a week with several other parents. She describes this activity as “hell on earth” and reports that on a number of occasions she has experienced “the worst anxiety imaginable.” She states that several times, when talking with the other parents, she has experienced a lot of “distressing” symptoms that come on suddenly, including feeling shaky, faint, heart palpitations, and a sensation that she is “outside of her body.”  Now, she has started to feel very anxious that she will have another episode from the time she wakes up on the days she is scheduled to volunteer at the school, and says, “I don’t want to put myself through that.”  On several occasions, she has called the school to say that she did not feel well and could not come in. She thinks that this will make others’ judgments of her even worse. She notes that she only experiences these symptoms of extreme anxiety when interacting with the other parents. JL says that she prefers to stay at home and care for the children. She is happy to spend time with her small group of friends that she has known for many years, but when she attends parties, or other social engagements, she says, “I don’t really enjoy it. I just don’t like having to talk to people I don’t know. I never know what to say and they probably think I am stupid.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional Background Information:\n",
        "JL reports that she has always been in good health, except for an appendectomy 10 years ago. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and has never used any substances.\n",
        "\n",
        "CORRECT DIAGNOSIS: ICD-11: Social Anxiety Disorder\n",
        "\n",
        "Reason why Diagnosis example is correct: Based on the provided vignette and guidelines, JL's case aligns well with the diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) as per ICD-11 criteria. SAD is characterized by marked and excessive fear or anxiety in social situations, where the individual fears negative evaluation by others. JL exhibits this through her dread of interacting with other parents and her perception that they judge her negatively, despite lacking concrete examples of such judgment. Her anxiety is specifically triggered in social contexts (e.g., school volunteering, parties), leading to avoidance behaviors (e.g., calling in sick) and significant distress. Additionally, her panic attacks, which include symptoms like shakiness, heart palpitations, and depersonalization, occur in anticipation of or during social interactions, further supporting the SAD diagnosis. These symptoms interfere with her daily functioning and are persistent, fulfilling the criteria for SAD. The absence of substance use or other health issues rules out alternative causes, solidifying the appropriateness of the SAD diagnosis for JL.\n",

TM’s mother reports TM has always been a “shy but likeable kid.” His avoidance of going to school started at the beginning of the current school year, about 8 months ago, after his family moved and he started attending a new school. On most school mornings, TM begs her to let him stay home. TM’s mother tries to force him to go, but says that “sometimes it is just too much of a battle.” She became seriously concerned when the school notified her that he had missed several school days when she thought he had gone to school. TM is not doing well in school because, in addition to his many absences, when the teacher calls on him, he says “I just freeze. Even if I know the answer, I can’t say it. I just turn all red and look like an idiot.” TM admits that he has always had a hard time talking to people he doesn’t know well. He had a few friends at his former school because “I was at the same school my whole life and we all knew each other.” He is having great difficulty making friends at his new school, because he is worried that the other kids think he is “a total loser.” TM thinks about this all the time and says he has trouble sleeping because of it. He would like to have friends and be popular, and wishes he could be more relaxed and confident enough to interact with new people.\n",
        "TM’s mother mentions that TM spends most evenings and weekends reading or playing video games in his room, activities that he says he enjoys thoroughly. TM used to play soccer at his old school, and was considered a good player. However, he has been unable to introduce himself to the coach at the new school, and try out for the team, because he would have to do this in front of the other players. He is worried that he would do a bad job during the try-out because of his nervousness, and the other players would look down on him for not being good enough. TM’s mother reports that she was initially concerned that TM was being bullied at school, but after speaking with his teachers and parents of classmates, she found no indication that he was being harassed. TM eventually responds, “No, it’s not them. It’s me.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Additional Backgroud Information:\n",
        " TM’s parents are divorced and his father lives in another city, but they speak over the phone several times a week. After his mother is asked to leave the room, TM reports that he does not use drugs, but does admit that he has drunk alcohol on several occasions and once smoked a cigarette. At a recent check-up, TM’s family doctor found him to be in good health.\n",
